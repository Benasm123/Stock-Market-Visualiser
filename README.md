# Machine Learning on Stock Markets Visualiser.
A tool for visualising actions of a reinforcement learning algorithm on making trades on stock markets.
This was my dissertation project for my third year in Computer Science.

## Implementation
The graphical interface is implemented using C++, using the Vulkan API, along side DearImGui, and the machine learning aspect was created using Python, which the C++ application would call.
